📖 Project Description

This project aims to predict customer churn at Beta Bank using Machine Learning techniques. Based on customer behavior data, we seek to identify clients at higher risk of churn and provide strategic insights for retention.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build high-performance predictive churn models  
- Compare different classification algorithms  
- Analyze the impact of various features on churn risk  
- Evaluate performance metrics, prioritizing F1-score and AUC-ROC  

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains information about Beta Bank customers, including:

- Demographic data (age, gender, location)  
- Transaction history and financial activity  
- Interactions with bank products and services  
- Churn status (active or churned customer)  

*Note: All data used in this project is fictional or anonymized for study purposes.*

## ⚙️ Methodology

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualizing distributions and correlations  
- Identifying missing values and outliers  

**Preprocessing**

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Normalization and standardization (StandardScaler)  

**Modeling**

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)  

**Handling Imbalanced Data**

- Oversampling (SMOTE)  
- Undersampling  

**Model Evaluation**

- F1-score, AUC-ROC  
- Confusion matrix  
- Comparing metrics across models  

## 📊 Results

- Best-performing model: LightGBM  
- Most relevant features: feature1, feature2, feature3  
- Strategic insights generated for customer retention actions  

## 💡 Conclusion

The project demonstrates how Machine Learning techniques can help banks identify at-risk customers and implement more effective retention strategies.
